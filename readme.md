## 🚀 Project Overview

**MCP for Security** repository contains Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations for various security testing tools, making them accessible through a standardized interface.

---

## 🌐 Installation 

### Docker

You can use all MCP servers through Docker using the cyprox/mcp-for-security Docker image. It can also be used from any MCP client with Docker support, such as the Cyprox platform.
Visit [Cyprox](https://cyprox.io) for more information.

### Manuel
Since each MCP server may require different dependencies, the `start.sh` bash script provides a general setup mechanism. Nonetheless, users should always refer to the installation instructions specific to the corresponding MCP server to ensure proper setup.

## Quick Reference

### Alterx MCP  
Generates custom wordlists for subdomain discovery using pattern-based permutations.

### Amass MCP  
Advanced reconnaissance tool for subdomain enumeration and intelligence gathering with both passive and active modes.

### arjun MCP  
Discovers hidden HTTP parameters on web applications by scanning URLs, supporting custom wordlists, multiple methods, and adjustable scanning speeds.

### Assetfinder MCP
Discovers subdomains related to a given domain using passive enumeration techniques. Integrates Tomnomnom’s Assetfinder into the MCP ecosystem for fast and reliable reconnaissance.

### Cero MCP Server
Certificate-based subdomain discovery tool that extracts domain names from TLS certificates for reconnaissance and infrastructure mapping.

### Certificate Search (crt.sh) MCP
